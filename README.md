# OpenAI Realtime Console

The OpenAI Realtime Console is intended as an inspector and interactive API reference
for the OpenAI Realtime API. It comes packaged with two utility libraries,
[openai/openai-realtime-api-beta](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-api-beta)
that acts as a **Reference Client** (for browser and Node.js) and
[`/src/lib/wavtools`](./src/lib/wavtools) which allows for simple audio
management in the browser.
